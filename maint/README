MAINTENANCE README FOR PCRE
---------------------------

The files in the "maint" directory of the PCRE source contain data, scripts, 
and programs that are used for the maintenance of PCRE, but which do not form
part of the PCRE distribution tarballs. This document describes these files and 
also contains some notes for maintainers. Its contents are:

Files in the maint directory
----------------------------

Builducptable    A Perl script that creates the contents of the ucptable.h file
                 from two Unicode data files, which themselves are downloaded
                 from the Unicode web site. Run this script in the "maint"
                 directory.
                 
ManyConfigTests  A shell script that runs "configure, make, test" a number of
                 times with different configuration settings.
                 
Unicode.tables   The files in this directory, Scripts.txt and UnicodeData.txt, 
                 were downloaded from the Unicode web site. They contain 
                 information about Unicode characters and scripts.
                 
ucptest.c        A short C program for testing the Unicode property functions
                 in pcre_ucp_searchfuncs.c, mainly useful after rebuilding the
                 Unicode property table. Compile and run this in the "maint" 
                 directory.
                 
ucptestdata      A directory containing two files, testinput1 and testoutput1,
                 to use in conjunction with the ucptest program.
                 
utf8.c           A short, freestanding C program for converting a Unicode code
                 point into a sequence of bytes in the UTF-8 encoding, and vice
                 versa. If its argument is a hex number such as 0x1234, it
                 outputs a list of the equivalent UTF-8 bytes. If its argument
                 is sequence of concatenated UTF-8 bytes (e.g. e188b4) it
                 treats them as a UTF-8 character and outputs the equivalent
                 code point in hex.
                

Updating to a new Unicode release
---------------------------------

When there is a new release of Unicode, the files in Unicode.tables must be 
refreshed from the web site, and the Buildupctable script can then be run to 
generate a new version of ucptable.h. The ucptest program can be used to check 
that the resulting table works properly, using the data files in ucptestdata to 
check a number of test characters. 


Preparing for a PCRE release
----------------------------

This section contains a checklist of things that I consult before building a
distribution for a new release.

. Ensure that the version number and version date are correct in configure.ac.

. Run ./autogen.sh to ensure everything is up-to-date.

. Compile and test with many different config options, and combinations of 
  options. The maint/ManyConfigTests script now encapsulates this testing.
  
. Run perltest.pl on the test data for tests 1 and 4. The output should match
  the PCRE test output, apart from the version identification at the top. The 
  other tests are not Perl-compatible (they use various special PCRE options).

. Test on a number of different operating systems. In particular, at the moment 
  I can test on Solaris, using Sun's cc compiler (as a change from gcc). Adding 
  -xarch=v9 to the cc options does a 64-bit test, but it also needs -S 64 for 
  pcretest to increase the stack size for test 2. I also test on FreeBSD and 
  Linux (where I develop). 

. Test with valgrind by running "RunTest valgrind". There is also "RunGrepTest
  valgrind", though that takes quite a long time.
  
. It can also useful to test with Electric Fence, though the fact that it 
  grumbles for missing free() calls can be a nuisance. (A missing free() in 
  pcretest is hardly a big problem.) To build with EF, use:
    
    LIBS='/usr/lib/libefence.a -lpthread' with ./configure.

  Then all normal runs use it to check for buffer overflow. Also run everything
  with:
  
    EF_PROTECT_BELOW=1 <whatever>  
    
  because there have been problems with lookbehinds that looked too far. 
  
. Test with the emulated memmove() function by undefining HAVE_MEMMOVE and 
  HAVE_BCOPY in config.h.

. Documentation: check AUTHORS, COPYING, ChangeLog (check date), INSTALL, 
  LICENCE, NEWS (check date), NON-UNIX-USE, and README. Many of these won't 
  need changing, but over the long term things do change.
  
. Man pages: Check all man pages for \ not followed by e or f or " because
  that indicates a markup error.


Making a PCRE release
---------------------

Run PrepareRelease and commit the files that it changes (by removing trailing
spaces). Then run "make dist" to create the tarballs and the zipball.

Don't forget to update Freshmeat when the new release is out, and to tell
webmaster@pcre.org and the mailing list.


Future ideas (wish list)
------------------------

This section records a list of ideas so that they do not get forgotten. They
vary enormously in their usefulness and potential for implementation. Some are 
very sensible; some are rather wacky. Some have been on this list for years;
others are relatively new.

. Optimization

  There are always ideas for new optimizations so as to speed up pattern 
  matching. Most of them try to save work by recognizing a non-match without 
  having to scan all the possibilities. These are some that I've recorded:

  * /((A{0,5}){0,5}){0,5}(something complex)/ on a non-matching string is very
    slow, though Perl is fast. Can we speed up somehow? Convert to {0,125}?
    OTOH, this is pathological - the user could easily fix it. 
    
  * Turn ={4} into ==== ? (for speed). I once did an experiment, and it seems
    to have little effect, and maybe makes things worse.
  
  * "Ends with literal string" - note that a single character doesn't gain much 
    over the existing "required byte" (reqbyte) feature that just saves one
    byte.
  
  * These probably need to go in study():
  
    o Remember an initial string rather than just 1 char?
    
    o A required byte from alternatives - not just the last char, but an
      earlier one if common to all alternatives.
      
    o Minimum length of subject needed.
    
    o Friedl contains other ideas.
    
. If Perl gets to a consistent state over the settings of capturing sub-
  patterns inside repeats, see if we can match it. One example of the
  difference is the matching of /(main(O)?)+/ against mainOmain, where PCRE
  leaves $2 set. In Perl, it's unset. Changing this in PCRE will be very hard
  because I think it needs much more state to be remembered.
  
. Perl 6 will be a revolution. Is it a revolution too far for PCRE? 

. Unicode

  * Note that in Perl, \s matches \pZ and similarly for \d, \w and the POSIX 
    character classes. For the moment, I've chosen not to support this for 
    backward compatibility, for speed, and because it would be messy to 
    implement.
      
  * A different approach to Unicode might be to use a typedef to do everything
    in unsigned shorts instead of unsigned chars. Actually, we'd have to have a
    new typedef to distinguish data from bits of compiled pattern that are in
    bytes, I think. There would need to be conversion functions in and out. I
    don't think this is particularly trivial - and anyway, Unicode now has
    characters that need more than 16 bits, so is this at all sensible?
  
  * There has been a request for direct support of 16-bit characters and
    UTF-16. However, since Unicode is moving beyond purely 16-bit characters,
    is this worth it at all? One possible way of handling 16-bit characters
    would be to "load" them in the same way that UTF-8 characters are loaded.
    
. Allow errorptr and erroroffset to be NULL. I don't like this idea.

. Line endings:

  * Option to use NUL as a line terminator in subject strings. This could now
    be done relatively easily since the extension to support LF, CR, and CRLF.
    If this is done, a suitable option for pcregrep is also required. 
    
. Option to provide the pattern with a length instead of with a NUL terminator.
  This probably affects quite a few places in the code. 

. Catch SIGSEGV for stack overflows?  
  
. "Cut" as described in Jeffrey Friedl's book, p364: \v and \V. The definitions
  aren't yet clear enough for me. \v flushes saved states so that no
  backtracking to anything earlier can happen; \V says "no more bumpalong", but
  does it fail the current match? As described in the book, these aren't really
  "cut" as in Prolog, are they? NOTE: (a) PCRE once had "cut", but it was
  removed when atomic groups were introduced. (b) Perl 5.10 has some (*PRUNE) 
  features -- see below.

. A feature to suspend a match via a callout was once requested.

. Option to convert results into character offsets and character lengths.

. Option for pcregrep to scan only the start of a file. I am not keen - this is 
  the job of "head".
  
. A (non-Unix) user wanted pcregrep options to (a) list a file name just once, 
  preceded by a blank line, instead of adding it to every matched line, and (b)
  support --outputfile=name.
  
. Consider making UTF-8 and UCP the default for PCRE n.0 for some n > 7.

. Add a user pointer to pcre_malloc/free functions -- some option would be 
  needed to retain backward compatibility.
  
. Define a union for the results from pcre_fullinfo().

. Provide a "random access to the subject" facility so that the way in which it 
  is stored is independent of PCRE. For efficiency, it probably isn't possible 
  to switch this dynamically. It would have to be specified when PCRE was
  compiled. PCRE would then call a function every time it wanted a character.
  
. There are new (*PRUNE) facilities in Perl 5.10, some of which it might be
  relatively easy to implement.
  
. Also in Perl 5.10 are relative subroutine references (?&-1) and (?&+1) which
  I didn't know about when I added some 5.10 features for PCRE 7.0. What about
  (?(-1)... as a condition? That's an obvious extension, even if Perl 5.10 
  doesn't have it.
  
. Wild thought: the ability to compile from PCRE's internal byte code to a real
  FSM and a very fast (third) matcher to process the result. There would be
  even more restrictions than for pcre_dfa_exec(), however. This is not easy.
  
. Should pcretest have some private locale data, to avoid relying on the
  available locales for the test data, since different OS have different ideas?
  This won't be as thorough a test, but perhaps that doesn't really matter.
  
. pcregrep: add -rs for a sorted recurse? Having to store file names and sort 
  them will of course slow it down.

. Re-arrange test 2: take out the link-size dependent stuff for a separate test 
  that is run only when the link size *is* 2; leave in some non-numbered 
  debugging tests using the new /Z feature.
  
. Stan Switzer's goto replacement for longjmp, which is apparently very slow on
  OS-X. This is used when stack recursion is disabled. It would be worth doing 
  some timing tests on other OS.

. Someone suggested --disable-callout to save code space when callouts are 
  never wanted. This seems rather marginal.
